				<h2><span class="red-dot mr10">1</span>Idea</h2>
				<p class="bold fs-medium">
					We designed Instagress to help you promote your Instagram
					account for more followers, likes, and comments.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you’ve ever wondered how certain businesses and celebrities
					have millions of followers on social media, you may be surprised
					to find out that they have entire social media teams dedicated
					to managing their accounts. That’s because amassing a huge
					number of Instagram followers takes a ton of manual work.
				</p>
				<p>
					So how do small businesses, up and coming celebrities, and
					new brands compete? Yes, you could hire a team of interns,
					or spend every waking hour on Instagram (which many people do),
					but we knew there had to be an easier way.

				<h2><span class="red-dot mr10">2</span>Realization</h2>
				<p class="bold fs-medium">
					Instagress began with a simple idea—that there’s an easier
					way to grow your Instagram followers.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the beginning, Instagress was simply a fun project to see
					if quality Instagram automation could actually be done.
				</p>
				<p>
					We started testing the software on our own Instagram accounts,
					but pretty soon everyone wanted to know how we had grown our
					Instagram accounts so quickly. Before we knew it, we had
					a startup on our hands.

				<h2><span class="red-dot mr10">3</span>The Power of Instagress</h2>
				<p class="bold fs-medium">
					Our main goal has always been to create user-friendly Instagram
					automation tool that mimic one’s natural behavior.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, many Instagress users say that they’re able to make
					connections with new followers who they would actually follow
					if they were using Instagram manually. That’s the power of
					Instagress. It’s like creating a small robot clone of yourself
					with the same interests and style, and then letting it work
					for you on Instagram. Some people just turn on Instagress
					while they’re sleeping, and love waking up to see all their
					new followers, likes and comments on their Instagram account.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, others choose to run Instagress nearly 24/7, just
					like a specially dedicated team of interns. That’s the beauty
					of Instagress—it’s all in your control.

					Instagress was born from a deep seated love of efficiency.
					We knew we could do it faster, safer, and more efficiently.

					It’s that same drive for perfection that keeps our team
